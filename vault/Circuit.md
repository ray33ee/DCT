The Circuit is composed of the following:

- Pin interface circuit - the circuitry that allows each pin to be an IO, GND or VCC pin.
- Secondary MCU - A MCU processor that can control one or more pin interface circuits
- Primary CPI - A CPU that can control multiple secondary MCUs via an [[Interface]]
