The DCT (Dynamic Chip Tester) is a device which can test 5V or 3.3V digital chips based on scripted tests.

Users can create, share and download their own tests which are simply scripts that apply logic inputs and verify outputs. If all outputs are within acceptable parameters, the test passes.

Each script contains information about the chip including number of pins, voltage, and whether the pin is an input (digital or analog), output, VCC, GND or unused. The script can apply logic levels, send pulses and communicate with I2C, SPI or UART to interface with the test chip. The script will also be able to test logic levels, test for rising/falling edges, measure pulse lengths and read back from I2C, SPI or UART to verify. The language also comes with various high level functions, math and other operations to make writing scripts easy.
